# dmenu-scripts
A small repository for my dmenu/rofi-dmenu scripts/menus

I personally use the scripts and they're tested to work. they are all bash based.

dmenu_web        - a web launcher
dmenu_shortcut   - shortcuts
dmenu_bash       - bash executor
dmenu_workspaces - changes workspaces (bspwm or i3)
